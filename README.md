## Holberton School Machine Learning
During this specialization, we are introduced and exposed to the core technologies and theories in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous driving, and more.  
We learn how to apply these concepts using technologies such as Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras. Throughout our studies, we dived deep into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, as well as the related mathematical principles.
